# The Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2h – 1:
#The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2l: 
# ++++=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#In a Binary Tree with N nodes, the minimum possible height or the minimum number of levels is Log2(N+1):Each level should have at least one element, so the height cannot be more than N. A binary tree of height ‘h’ can have a maximum of 2h – 1 nodes (previous property). So the number of nodes will be less than or equal to this maximum value

# ===============================
#  In a non-empty binary tree, if n is the total number of nodes and e is the total number of edges, then e = n-1:
#Binary trees have nodes with at most two child nodes: zero, one, or two.
# The top node in a binary tree is called the root node.
# Leaf nodes are nodes with no children.
# The height of a binary tree is the number of edges from the root to the deepest leaf.
# Full binary trees have only nodes with two children.
# Complete binary trees have all levels filled except for the last one.
# Balanced binary trees have similar heights for left and right subtrees.
# In-order, pre-order, and post-order are common traversal methods for binary trees.
